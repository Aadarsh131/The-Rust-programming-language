The performace of both `for` loop and `iterators` are almose same. In many cases, `iterators` is slightly faster than `for`.  

>The implementations of closures and iterators are such that runtime performance is not affected. This is part of Rustâ€™s goal to strive to provide **zero-cost abstractions**.
