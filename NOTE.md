## Why only rust?  
It matches the native performance of C/C++ being memory safe, thread safe, null safe, have excellent error handling etc all without having a Garbage Collector(GC). Comparison with high-level languages? forget about it, its no way near.

Rust is a modern language, with cargo as its package manager + build system together (the most loved feature for many devs), the compiler messages also is way better than many programming languages

Rust took many good features and syntax from other programming languages, including the first class support for functional programming

Companies need rust for competitive products either for systems programming or web backends, so the demand and salary of talented rust devs are very high
